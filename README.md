# Pokémon Sun and Moon IV calculator

This tool allows to facilitate Gen 7 speedrunning by determining Popplio's Individual Values based on its stats as Popplio's levels go up.

Effort values (EVs) are predetermined according to a specific route.

Another useful feature is the Hidden Power calculator that allows Pokémon Sun runners to usually determine Popplio's Hidden Power before picking Hidden Power up.

## How to use

The following guide describes the recommended steps when using this calculator.

### Select the game

On the left, make sure to select the game you are playing. EVs differ between Sun and Moon and therefore result in different stats at identical IVs.

### Nature

The nature is selected by specifying which stats are positive and negative. To do so, left click the column title that is positive and right click the column title that is negative.

* Red = positive
* Blue = negative
* White = neutral

Should the nature be neutral, you can click the Nature display on the bottom. That will define the Nature as Docile.

Clicking the mouse wheel on a column will remove the nature definition of that stat.

### Stats

Once you know a stat at a given level, select the value of that stat to narrow down the IV ranges.

### Level Up and Down

On the left, by clicking on + and - you can increase and decrease Popplio's level.

### Evolving

Once Popplio evolves to Brionne, clicking _Evo_ will adapt its base stats to Brionne's. Make sure to click evolve after having written down level 17's stats.

### Fought an optional?

In case something happened, you can add the EVs of the optional Pokémon manually at the bottom of each column.

For reference, common failures or adapatations: 

* Gastly: +1 Sp. Atk
* Pikachu: +2 Spd
* Cutiefly: +1 Spd
* Wishiwashi: +1 HP (Totem SoS: +2 HP)
* Alomomola: +2 HP (Totem SoS: +4 HP)
* Marowak: +2 Def
* Salandit: +1 Spd
* Trumbeak: +2 Atk
* Fomantis: +1 Atk

### Hidden Power

On the top, a list with all Hidden Powers is located. Next to each of them, a percentage shows how likely it is, based on the IV ranges that this Hidden Power will be Popplio's Hidden Power.

Once the Hidden Power is determined, left/right clicking _H. Power_ on the bottom sets the Hidden Power. You can also scroll with the mousewheel to do so. Pressing the mousewheel sets back an unkown Hidden Power.

### Reset

When nothing goes right, click on Reset.

### Undo

Pressing Ctrl + Z can undo the following actions: changing stat, changing manual EVs, evolving.
