# Pokémon Gen 3+ IV calculator

This tool allows to facilitate Gen 6 and 7 speedrunning by determining a Pokémon's Individual Values based on its stats as the Pokémon's levels go up.

Effort values (EVs) are predetermined according to a specific route.

Another useful feature is the Hidden Power calculator that allows runners to usually determine a Pokémon's Hidden Power without explicitly checking its type.

## How to use

The following guide describes the recommended steps when using this calculator.

### Nature

The nature is selected by specifying which stats are positive and negative. To do so, left click the column title that is positive and right click the column title that is negative.

* Red = positive
* Blue = negative
* White = neutral

Should the nature be neutral, you can click the Nature display on the bottom. That will define the Nature as Docile.

Clicking the mouse wheel on a column will remove the nature definition of that stat.

### Stats

Once you know a stat at a given level, select the value of that stat to narrow down the IV ranges.

### Level Up and Down

On the left, by clicking on + and - you can increase and decrease the Pokémon's level.

### Evolving

Once a Pokémon is supposed to be evovled (for example when Popplio evolves to Brionne), clicking _Evo_ will adapt its base stats to the evolved Pokémon's ones. 

### Fought an optional?

In case something happened, you can add the EVs of the optional Pokémon manually at the bottom of each column.

For reference, common failures or adapatations in Pokémon Sun/Moon: 

* Gastly: +1 Sp. Atk
* Pikachu: +2 Spd
* Cutiefly: +1 Spd
* Wishiwashi: +1 HP (Totem SoS: +2 HP)
* Alomomola: +2 HP (Totem SoS: +4 HP)
* Marowak: +2 Def
* Salandit: +1 Spd
* Trumbeak: +2 Atk
* Fomantis: +1 Atk

### Hidden Power

On the top, a list with all Hidden Powers is located. Next to each of them, a percentage shows how likely it is, based on the IV ranges that this Hidden Power will be the Pokémon's Hidden Power.

Once the Hidden Power is determined, left/right clicking _H. Power_ on the bottom sets the Hidden Power. You can also scroll with the mousewheel to do so. Pressing the mousewheel sets back an unkown Hidden Power.

### Reset

When nothing goes right, click on Reset.

### Undo

Pressing Ctrl + Z can undo the following actions: changing stat, changing manual EVs, evolving.
